*** 90s TRIVIA! ***


*** What this does ***

This is a five question trivia game based on 90s movies, tv shows, and music. The user picks from four options and is given the correct answer after each choice. The user's score is visible at the top of the screen along with the question number.


*** What is still under construction ***

!!! I used a basic javascript video as a reference to start the project only to later find out we are supposed to use jQuery (my fault for not paying attention to detail). At some point I would like to clean this up and have it completely jQuery-- not a Frankenstein combination of javascript and jQuery.

GIFs would also add some fun after each question is answered.
